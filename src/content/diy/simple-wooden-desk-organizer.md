Summary: A weekend project to build a beautiful and functional desk organizer from walnut. Perfect for beginners and requires only basic tools. Includes step-by-step instructions with photos.

# Building a Simple Wooden Desk Organizer

My desk was cluttered with pens, USB cables, and miscellaneous small items, so I decided to build a simple wooden organizer. This project is perfect for beginners - it requires only basic tools and can be completed in a weekend.

## Materials

- **Wood**: 1 piece of walnut board (12" x 6" x 3/4")
- **Finish**: Danish oil or polyurethane
- **Sandpaper**: 120, 180, 220 grit
- **Wood glue**: Any quality wood glue

## Tools Used

- Table saw (or hand saw)
- Drill with 1" Forstner bit
- Chisel set
- Clamps
- Measuring tape and pencil
- Square

## Design

The organizer has three compartments:
1. **Pen holder**: Multiple 1" diameter holes for pens and pencils
2. **Small items tray**: For paper clips, thumbtacks, etc.
3. **Phone stand**: Angled slot to hold a phone upright

## Step 1: Milling the Wood

I started with a rough walnut board and milled it to final dimensions. If you're buying lumber from a hardware store, you can skip this step.

1. Joint one face flat
2. Plane to 3/4" thickness
3. Rip to 6" width
4. Cut to 12" length

**Tip**: Check for any defects, knots, or cracks that might affect the final piece.

## Step 2: Layout and Marking

I divided the board into three sections and marked where each feature would go:

- Left third: 5 holes for pens (1" diameter, 3/4" deep)
- Middle third: Shallow tray (routed or chiseled out)
- Right third: Phone stand slot (3/8" wide, angled at 70°)

**Tip**: Use a square to ensure your marks are straight and perpendicular.

## Step 3: Drilling Pen Holes

Using a 1" Forstner bit in the drill press, I drilled 5 holes about 3/4" deep. Space them evenly - I used 1.5" center-to-center spacing.

**Important**: Clamp the wood securely and use a depth stop to ensure consistent hole depth. Forstner bits create clean, flat-bottomed holes perfect for this application.

## Step 4: Creating the Tray

For the middle compartment, I used a router with a 1/2" straight bit to hollow out a shallow tray about 1/4" deep. 

Alternatively, you can:
- Use a chisel to carefully remove material
- Use a drill with multiple holes and clean up with a chisel

## Step 5: Phone Stand Slot

The trickiest part was cutting the angled slot for the phone stand. I used the table saw:

1. Set blade to 20° angle (creates a 70° resting angle)
2. Set fence for 3/8" width
3. Make multiple passes to create the slot
4. Clean up with sandpaper

**Safety Note**: This cut requires extra care. Use push sticks and keep hands well away from the blade.

## Step 6: Sanding

Sanding is crucial for a professional finish. I worked through three grits:

1. **120 grit**: Remove any tool marks and rough spots
2. **180 grit**: Smooth the surface
3. **220 grit**: Final smoothing before finish

Pay special attention to the inside of the holes and tray - these are visible in use.

## Step 7: Applying Finish

I chose Danish oil for its natural look and easy application:

1. Apply generous coat with a brush or rag
2. Let penetrate for 15 minutes
3. Wipe off excess
4. Wait 24 hours
5. Apply second coat
6. Optional: third coat for more protection

The walnut grain really came alive with the oil - beautiful!

## Final Result

After 24 hours of drying, the organizer was ready to use. The dark walnut with natural oil finish looks elegant on my desk and keeps everything organized.

## What I Learned

- **Forstner bits are worth it**: They create clean holes that make projects look professional
- **Take time with sanding**: The difference between 120 and 220 grit is huge
- **Oil brings out the grain**: Danish oil really showcases the natural beauty of walnut
- **Measure twice, cut once**: This old saying saved me from several mistakes

## Variations and Improvements

For future versions, I might:
- Add a divider in the tray section
- Include a slot for SD cards or USB drives
- Add rubber feet to prevent sliding
- Create a matching laptop stand

## Cost Breakdown

- Walnut board: $25
- Danish oil (had on hand): ~$5
- Sandpaper: $3
- **Total**: ~$33

For comparison, similar organizers online cost $60-100, and this one has the satisfaction of being handmade!

## Tips for Beginners

1. **Start with softwood**: Pine or poplar are easier to work with and cheaper
2. **Don't skip safety gear**: Safety glasses and dust mask are essential
3. **Sharp tools are safer**: Keep chisels and drill bits sharp
4. **Practice on scrap**: Test cuts and finishes on scrap wood first
5. **Be patient**: Rushing leads to mistakes

## Conclusion

This was a satisfying weekend project that solved a real problem. The organizer has been on my desk for two weeks now and I use it every day. There's something special about using something you built yourself.

If you build your own version, I'd love to see it! [Send me photos](/contact/) or tag me on Instagram with #blacklinesDIY.
