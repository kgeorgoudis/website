# Welcome to Blacklines.gr

Welcome! I'm Konstantinos Georgoudis, and this is my digital space where I share my passions: DevOps practices, visual communication through sketchnotes, and hands-on DIY projects.

## About Me

I'm a technology enthusiast with a love for both the digital and physical worlds. By day, I work with modern DevOps tools and practices, helping teams build better software faster and more reliably. By night (and weekends!), you'll find me either sketching ideas and concepts or in my workshop building things with wood and other materials.

This website is where these worlds collide. Here you'll find:

- **DevOps Notes & Articles**: Technical insights, tutorials, and lessons learned from working with containers, CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code, and cloud platforms
- **Sketchnotes & Urban Sketches**: Visual notes from conferences, books, and ideas, plus urban sketches from my travels and daily observations
- **DIY & Woodworking Projects**: Step-by-step builds, crafts, and creations from my workshop, complete with photos and building notes

## Philosophy

I believe in learning by doing, sharing knowledge openly, and finding creative solutions to problems. Whether it's automating a deployment pipeline, capturing an idea in a quick sketch, or building a piece of furniture, the process is just as important as the result.
